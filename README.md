Question 1:
Consider the following expression
15Ñ… -
7x -
y(x) =
Prerequisite:
Use the Scripts in xxt.sql, transf.sql and data.sql to create the corresponding Schema objects.
Task:
Consider the values in table xxt.
Using column id as x, write an anonymous block that would perform the following translation:
For every row in xxt, insert the following into table transf
id
/y(xxt.id)
id2
xxt.id
coll
col3
col4
concatenate (row "" of , xxt.col1) where i is the iteration value of that distinct value of xxt.col1 e.g. 'row 1 of Center' means this is the first occurrence of value Center in the loop while 'row 7 of center' means that is the 7th occurrence. *Please note that the iteration count is different for each distinct value.
The value today's date + xxt.id days e.g. if xxt.id =4, u add 4 days to system date
The value today's date - xxt.id days e.g. if xxt.id =4, u subtract 4 days to system date

Question 2:
you are involved in a data conversion project and one of your tasks is the migration of Payment Check books from the Legacy System to the New System.

The Data of both tables will need to be correctly mapped and a PL/SQL Data conversion and Transformation script should be written to move only unpaid checks from the Legacy table to the new table.
Question 3:
Write a recursive function to calculate factorial (given that n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)*.. *1)
Question 4:
Write a PL/SQL function that would reverse a string passed to it such that it will return the even placed strings in reverse before the odd, i.e., if you pass "ABCDEF" to it, it should return "FBECA"
